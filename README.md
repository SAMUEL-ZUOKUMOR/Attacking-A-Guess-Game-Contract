`Randomness` is a hard problem. Computers run code that is written by programmers, and follows a given sequence of steps. As such, it is extremely hard to design an algorithm that will give you a 'random' number, since that random number must be coming from an algorithm that follows a certain sequence of steps. Now, of course, some functions are better than others.

## BUILD
`A game where there is a pack of cards.`
`Each card has a number associated with it which ranges from 0 to 2²⁵⁶–1`
`Player will guess a number that is going to be picked up.`
`The dealer will then at random pick up a card from the pack`
`If someone correctly guesses the number, they win 0.1 ETH`
`We will hack this game today :)`






# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
